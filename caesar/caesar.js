/*
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, 
the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the 
simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a 
type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext 
is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would 
become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used 
it in his private correspondence.

write a function that takes a string to be encoded and a shift factor 
and then returns the encoded string:
*/
//takes in two params:
//string - the word or phrase to be encoded
//number - shift factor, how many places down the alphabet its shifted

//retains capitalization
//does not shift punctuation
//continuous Z - A
//works for negative numbers (shifts backwards)

const caesar = function() {};

module.exports = caesar;
